This is the new CLI tool for [Rundeck](https://github.com/rundeck/rundeck).

Its goal is to replace the old CLI Tools currently included with Rundeck
with a modernized, extensible, and nicer implementation.

The functionality of previous "rd-*" tools (from Rundeck) is now split into subcommands.

## Requirements

Java 8
